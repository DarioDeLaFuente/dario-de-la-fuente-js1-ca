# Level 1 Process

Search for a public, free-to-use API.

You will need to make two calls to this API:
**to fetch an array of results**
**to fetch a single result using an id, name, or other property.**

You will need to read the API's documentation to see what URLs are available, if they require a key to be sent in the header, and any other configuration they might need.

There are many free APIs discoverable by a Google search.

You may not use the APIs used in the lessons.

I used thes API:

# rickandmortyapi.com

The code of the [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com) site.

**For more information about the API check [here](https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api)**

Run locally with

```
git clone https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api-site.git
cd rick-and-morty-api-site
npm install
npm run dev
```
